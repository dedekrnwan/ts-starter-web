### Application

Application or Source file of this project is in `app` and compiled to `dist`

> App folder is for logical file like `controller`, `models` or `entity`, `helper`, `middleware`,`config`, and `services` 

    .

    |       └── **.key              # .key file in this folder used for jwt secret key
    └── ...


### Lib

Lib folder used for your Express Js setup 

> Lib folder is only `app.ts` and `server.ts`

    .
    ├── lib
    |   ├── app.ts                  # Setting app your express app in this file
    │   └── server.ts               # Running express app

### Public

Public folder used for your open path or static path to save your `attachment` or `assets`

> Public folder has been called before in `app.ts` for static middleware

    .
    ├── public
    |   ├── attachment              # Attachment folder 
    │   └── assets                  # Your application asstes file


### Automated tests

Automated tests are usually placed into the `tests` or, less commonly, into the `spec` or `test` folder.

> **Q: Why tests are placed into a separate folder, as opposed to having them closer to the code under testS?**
>
> **A:** Because you don't want to test the code, you want to tests the *program*.
